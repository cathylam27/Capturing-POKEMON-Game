# Virtual Capturing POKEMON Game

This is a virtual game version of capturing POKEMON! Players gain POKEMON’s favorability by choosing an option, thereby players can capture the POKEMON. If the POKEMON get full favorability then they will follow you, it’s meaning you win as you are capturing them successfully. Instead, if the POKEMON leaves the player, you will lose. Continue to play until the player captures POKEMON or POKEMON leaves the player to end the game.
